Description: scCoExpNets is an easy-to-use multi-model method to create single-cell gene co-expression networks. For each cell-type, it collapse
    pairs of cells that belongs to the same individual while the number of cells is over a threshold, thus getting multiple matrices 
    and multiple scGCNs for the same cell type. Thanks to the creation of multiple networks for the same cell type, scCoExpNets is able to detect
    modules robust to sparsity through pseudo-cells iterations as well as modules that evolves through iterations leading to potentially 
    interesting modules. Similarly, scCoExpNets allow the user to detect GO subgraphs maintained in all iterations as well as GO subgraphs that
    emerge through pseudo-cells iterations as completely new subgraphs or more specialized or expanded subgraphs. To compare multiple networks from
    the same cell type, scCoExpNets includes new ways to annotate the modules, new types of visualization as well as interactive browser to detect
    interesting modules.
