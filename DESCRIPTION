Description: We propose a new strategy to tackle single-cell sparsity: 
    for each cell type, we collapse pairs of cells that belongs to the 
    same individual while the number of cells is > 200, thus getting multiple matrices 
    and multiple scGCNs. Then, we characterize each module of each GCN based on 
    different criteria: functional enrichment analysis, phenotype enrichment analysis, 
    module-trait corr, cell type markers enrichment and neurological disorders panel 
    enrichment.
